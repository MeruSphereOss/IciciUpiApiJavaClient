# ICICI UPI API Java Client

This project is an implementation of the **ICICI UPI API Specification** in Java. It provides a client that can communicate with ICICIâ€™s UPI API to process transactions, encrypt/decrypt data, and generate QR codes.

## Folder Structure

### 1. model
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/merusphere/model`

This package contains Java classes responsible for preparing request data for the ICICI UPI API. The classes in this package format and organize the data before it is sent to the API.

### 2. upi
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/merusphere/upi`

This package contains Java classes responsible for interacting with the ICICI UPI API. It handles sending requests to the API and processing the responses received from the ICICI UPI endpoints.

### 3. util
**Path:** `src/main/java/com/merusphere/util`

This package includes utility classes that:
- Encrypt and decrypt the request and response data exchanged with the ICICI API.
- Generate UPI payment QR codes to facilitate transactions.

### 4. resources
**Path:** `src/main/resources`

This directory contains the essential security keys used for encryption and decryption:
